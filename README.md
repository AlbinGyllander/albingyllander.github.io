# Simple Slot Machine
This project is a simple slot machine with five reels that spin. Upon stop potential winnings is displayed and in that case the winning symbols are animated using a function that works by being passed a very long image, called a spritesheet. 

Note that the images that are uploaded in this repository is not my own. I have found them as Gifs then converted them to spritesheets. The original owners/designers/creators of all images except the background are named: Michael Gavronskij and Marta Woolf. The originals was published to Behance.net and can be accessed at the following URL:

The background is designed and published by Gale Titus with the title "CE Egyptisk Frame 1" with the license CC0 Public Domain meaning it is free to use. The background can be accessed at the following URL:
